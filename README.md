# Module 3: reproducible reports and data analysis

Rationale (3 lines max): Reproducible research is at the heart of science. There has been an increased need and willingness to open and share research from the data right through to the interpretations of results. This has come with its own set of challenges, which include designing workflows that can be adopted by collaborators in a way that does not compromise the integrity of their contribution. This module will introduce the necessary tools required for transparent reporting which is reproducible and readable. 

Learning Objectives (specific): Specific objective will include workflow design, source data management, data manipulation, dynamic reporting and reproducible analysis.

- LO3a: Learn about the nature of reproducible research, what the key requirements are, and which resources are available to support a workflow for reproducible research (knowledge)
- LO3b: Be able to use available resources for reproducible research; be able to use a workflow which leads to reproducible research
